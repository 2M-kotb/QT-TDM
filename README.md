The official Pytorch implementation of QT-TDM model presented in paper:

[QT-TDM:Planning with Transformer Dynamics Model and Autoregressive Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18841)


# Method
QT-TDM is a Transformer-based model-based algorithm that consists of two modules: __(a)Transformer Dynamics Model (TDM)__ ; __(b) Q-Transformer (QT)__
